# Farmer's Network

## Description
This is the third JHU Bootcamp team project collaboration, focused on: html, css, javascript, node.js, Express, React, NoSQL, use of a monogoDB database, and responsive web design. The title of our innovative project idea is FarmerNetwork. It is an application that allows a user to search any kind of local farm's product of his/her choice. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated files. This application emphasizes the use of React UI design of front end to provide the better interaction to the farmer to buy and sell their products online, to get information from commercially and locally-available sources and interact with user input data to generate the new avilable local products, information about the resources, and save it for the future overview.
